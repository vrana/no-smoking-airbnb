Chrome extension highlighting Smoking Allowed places on airbnb.com.

Airbnb doesn't warn guests about places where smoking is allowed strongly enough. It only shows "Smoking Allowed" in the place's Amenities. This extension makes these places much better visible by placing a big sign in the corner of the page.

It works in all Airbnb language versions.
